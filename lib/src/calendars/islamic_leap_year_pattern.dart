/// The pattern of leap years to use when constructing an Islamic calendar.
///
/// The Islamic, or Hijri, calendar is a lunar calendar of 12 months, each of 29 or 30 days.
/// The calendar can be defined in either observational or tabular terms;
/// Time Machine implements a tabular calendar, where a pattern of leap years (in which the last month has
/// an extra day) repeats every 30 years, according to one of the patterns within this enum.
///
/// While the patterns themselves are reasonably commonly documented (see e.g.
/// [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabular_Islamic_calendar))
/// there is little standardization in terms of naming the patterns. I hope the current names do not
/// cause offence to anyone; suggestions for better names would be welcome.
/// ( ^^^ this is a note from upstream NodaTime -- so if this comes up, we need to get
/// everyone involved)

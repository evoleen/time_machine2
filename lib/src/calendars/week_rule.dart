/// A rule determining how 'week years' are arranged, including the weeks within the week year.
/// Implementations provided by Time Machine itself can be obtained via the [WeekYearRules]
/// class.
///
/// Dates are usually identified within a calendar system by a calendar year, a month within that
/// calendar year, and a day within that month. For example, the date of birth of Ada Lovelace can be identified
/// within the Gregorian calendar system as the year 1815, the month December (12), and the day 10. However,
/// dates can also be identified (again within a calendar system) by week-year, week and day-of-week. How
/// that identification occurs depends on which rule you use - but again as an example, within the Gregorian
/// calendar system, using the ISO-8601 week year rule, the date of Ada Lovelace's birth is week-year 1815,
/// week 49, day-of-week Sunday.
///
/// The calendar year of a date and the week-year of a date are the same in most rules for most dates, but aren't
/// always. When they differ, it is usually because a day near the start of the calendar year is deemed to belong
/// to the last week of the previous week-year - or conversely because a day near the end of the calendar year is
/// deemed to belong to the first week of the following week-year. Some rules may be more radical -
/// a UK tax year rule could number weeks from April 6th onwards, such that any date earlier than that in the calendar
/// year would belong to the previous week-year.
///
/// The mapping of dates into week-year, week and day-of-week is always relative to a specific calendar system.
/// For example, years in the Hebrew calendar system vary very significantly in length due to leap months, and this
/// is reflected in the number of weeks within the week-years - as low as 50, and as high as 55.
///
/// This class allows conversions between the two schemes of identifying dates: [GetWeekYear(LocalDate)]
/// and [GetWeekOfWeekYear(LocalDate)] allow the week-year and week to be obtained for a date, and
/// [GetLocalDate(int, int, IsoDayOfWeek, CalendarSystem)] allows the reverse mapping. Note that
/// the calendar system does not need to be specified in the former methods as a [LocalDate] already
/// contains calendar information, and there is no method to obtain the day-of-week as that is not affected by the
/// week year rule being used.
///
/// All implementations within Time Machine are immutable, and it is advised that any external implementations
/// should be immutable too.
